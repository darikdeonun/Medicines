[Pain relief pills](https://pixelsmedstore.com/product-category/pain-relief-pills/) are medications that are used to reduce or eliminate pain. They are one of the most commonly used types of medication in the world, and are available over-the-counter and by prescription.
There are many different types of pain relief pills, but they all work in a similar way. They block the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that are released by the body in response to injury or inflammation. Prostaglandins are responsible for many of the symptoms of pain, such as swelling, redness, and heat.
